Type Conversion :
    Data to Data


Types to Type Conversion :
    i. Promotion : char -> int -> float.
    ii. Demotion : float -> int -> char.

Technique : 
    _Implicit Type Conversion : 
        Compiler automatically converts the type as per as 
        a partial command.

    _Expicit Type Conversion : 
        The Conversion which will be handled by the programmer 
        at full time of the program. It is also known as Type Casting.

**Truncation :  Which automatically delete some part for support on other form.
                (only in Demotion)
                eg. float y = 34.32; int x = y; // x will be 34.. deleted part 
                                                    is truncation.
